# Market-research-analysis
Analysis and AB Testing was conducted on market data gathered to test the effectiveness of advertisements and public service announcements (psas) on sales.
The aim of the analysis was to determine if the ads actually increased sales, and if the difference between the group shown ads alone and the group shown psas alone were statistically significant.
